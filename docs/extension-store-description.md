ChatGPT Diagram Renderer

ChatGPT can create extensive visualizations for complex information, such as diagrams, flowcharts, mind maps, and more. However, it renders them in a text-based format. This extension automatically converts these text-based descriptions into images and displays them directly within the ChatGPT interface.


Features:

- Ad-Free Experience: No ads, trackers, or requests for ratings or donations.
- Wide Diagram Support: Renders diagrams using PlantUML, Mermaid, Graphviz, and all formats supported by kroki.io.
- Easy to use: diagrams are rendered automatically with no additional steps required.
- Seamless Integration: Integrates smoothly into the ChatGPT web interface.
- Preserves Text: Original text descriptions of visualizations remain visible and copyable.
- Interactive Images: Click on images to enlarge them for better visibility.
- Dark Mode Support


Pro Tip:

To enhance your experience on the ChatGPT web interface:
- Click on your profile picture.
- Select "Customize ChatGPT".
- Scroll down to the second textarea.
- Enter a text like: "Make full use of all kroki.io supported formats to add one or more visualizations to your answers."


Privacy:

This extension uses the open source kroki.io API to render the images.
