Entire Source Code is in ./src/scripts/content.js.

To build it:
setup node.js (I used version 20)
run:
npm install .
npm run build

The extension is then in ./artifacts/firefox-extension.zip

To actually see it working you need to go to https://chatgpt.com (free account is enough) and ask it "visualize a sample pie chart, mind-map and UML diagram using kroki.io supported formats". You should then see images instead of just text descriptions.
